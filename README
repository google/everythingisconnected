Everything is connected

A knowledge puzzle game. For more user-facing information, see about.html.

The code is rather straightforward. Most of the trouble is about getting it
to run decently on mobile. Last time I checked, there was still a problem on
iOS (the tiles seem off).

There is no backend (besides Wikidata itself). The game runs entirely in the
browser.

Terminology from the code:
* a tile is a single piece of the puzzle, whether it is in the deck or on the
  board.
* the board is the place where all the tiles will eventually end up.
* the deck is the set of tiles that the player has available.

The starting tiles are literally part of the board, that is why they cannot
be moved. The code for the tiles in the deck and on the board overlap.

If you create new puzzles, please put them on my Wikidata user page:
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Denny/Everything_is_conntected
so that others can find them.

If you want to take over the maintenance of the code, I'd be very happy. Please
