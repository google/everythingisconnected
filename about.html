<em>Everything is connected.
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikidata%27s_World.webm">
Knowledge is to understand these connections</a>.</em>
		</p><p>
<strong>Everything is connected</strong> is a knowledge game &mdash;
a game relying on knowledge about the world in order to be solved.
Like a quiz, and yet different.
		</p><p>
<strong>Everything is connected</strong> is also a puzzle.
You get some pieces and have to figure out how they fit together.
How they are connected.
But unlike with a normal puzzle, whether or not two pieces fit together
does not depend on the shape of the piece - afterall, all pieces are squares
but it depends whether or not there is a known connection between them.
		</p><p>
What is a known connection? 
Each piece of the puzzle represents an entity in the world.
It can be a country, a famous person, a song, a religion, or something else
entirely.
There are hundreds of different types of relations:
for example, a person could be a <em>citizen</em> of a country, or
the <em>author</em> of a song.
A city can be the <em>place of a birth</em> of a person, or
the <em>capital</em> of a country.
		</p><p>
Just like in every other puzzle, in order to place a piece somewhere on the
board, it has to fit to all of its neighbours.
Once all pieces are placed, the puzzle is solved.

		<h2>How does the game know about the relations?</h2>
		<p>
The game is based on Wikidata, the free and open knowledge base.
Wikidata is like a machine-readable Wikipedia, although much younger.
And like Wikipedia, Wikidata can be edited by anyone.
Wikidata is incomplete and may contain errors.
If you find errors in Wikidata while playing <em>Everything is connected</em>,
you are welcome to join Wikidata and fix them.
		</p>
		<h2>Can I play this in other languages than English?</h2>
		<p>
Yes, you can.
		</p><p>
Just put the lang parameter to another language code.
More than 300 languages are available.
And if a certain puzzle piece doesn't have label in your language, you can
just go to Wikidata and add it there.
		</p><p>
Examples: play in
<a href="index.html?lang=de">German</a>,
<a href="index.html?lang=uz">Uzbek</a>,
<a href="index.html?lang=hr">Croatian</a>,
<a href="index.html?lang=es">Spanish</a>,
<a href="index.html?lang=zh">Chinese</a>,
<a href="index.html?lang=ru">Russian</a>, or
<a href="index.html?lang=ka">Georgian</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Can I create my own puzzles?</h2>
		<p>
Yes, you can.
		</p><p>
Probably the easiest way to do so is to take a pen and a paper, and first
create a "solved" puzzle:
make a grid, and fill every field you want to fill.
Not every field has to be filled - the result does not have to be a completely
filled square.
		</p><p>
Example:
<table>
	<tr><td> - </td><td>Jackie Kennedy</td><td>New York City</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harvard</td><td>JFK</td><td>USA</td></tr>
</table>
		</p><p>
Note that you can only use entities for the puzzle that are available in
Wikidata, and only relations that are known to Wikidata will be counted as
valid known relations.
		</p><p>
Now go to Wikidata, and for each of the entities find their corresponding Q-Id.
Write them down in the grid.
		</p><p>
Example:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td> - Q0</td>
		<td>
			Jackie Kennedy 
			<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q165421">Q165421</a>
		</td>
		<td>
			New York City 
			<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q60">Q60</a>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Harvard 
			<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q13371">Q13371</a>
		</td>
		<td>
			JFK 
			<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q9696">Q9696</a>
		</td>
		<td>
			USA 
			<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30">Q30</a>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
		</p><p>
Now start on the top line of your grid, and write the Q-Id consecutively down.
Once one line is finished, close it with a /, and then continue with the next
line.
If you have a gap in your grid, just put a Q0 there.
		</p><p>
Example:
for the above example, we would write down:
<i>Q0Q165421Q60/Q13371Q9696Q30</i>.
		</p><p>			
Finally, decide which of the tiles should already be preset and fixed - if any -
and add a + just right behind them.
		</p><p>
Example:
we could decide that Harvard will be preset, so we add a + just after Q13371:
<i>Q0Q165421Q60/Q13371+Q9696Q30</i>.
		</p><p>
The resulting string can be used as the board parameter on the URL for the game.
You can then send the URL to others to try to solve your puzzle.
		</p><p>
Example:
our example would be accessible at
<a href="index.html?board=Q0Q165421Q60/Q13371+Q9696Q30">
index.html?board=Q0Q165421Q60/Q13371+Q9696Q30</a>
<br>
You can even switch the language by adding a language parameter too, say, to Greek:
<a href="index.html?board=Q0Q165421Q60/Q13371+Q9696Q30&lang=el">
index.html?board=Q0Q165421Q60/Q13371+Q9696Q30&lang=el</a>
<i></i>.

If you create levels you like, share them on
<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Everything_is_connected">
my Wikidata page</a>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="unsolvable">Possibly unsolvable puzzles</h2>
		<p>
In order to minimize a frustrating playing experience, the game checks at the
beginning of a level whether the game is actual still solvable with the
original solution.
If it is not, the background will change to red, and a warning message will
be displayed.
		</p><p>
Because Wikidata can and does change all the time, a puzzle that once was
solvable could actually suddenly require a different solution, or even become
unsolvable at all.
		</p><p>
Sometimes this is due to errors being removed from Wikidata, on which the
puzzle was relying on, sometimes this is due to changes in the modeling of
Wikidata, and sometimes this is due to correct facts in Wikidata being removed.
If the latter, feel free to go to Wikidata and join the editing community in
order to put the correct data back in.
		</p><p>
Feel free to mark puzzles that are unsolvable as such on 
<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Everything_is_connected">
my Wikidata page</a> in case you arrived at the puzzle through that page.
		</p><p>
Note that a puzzle that you have been warned about can still have a solution -
but a different one than the originally envisioned ones.
The game does not check for all possible solutions, merely if the original
solution is still applicable.
